This repository contains the index.html and styles.css for the third freeCodeCamp course certificate, a documentation page. For this, I chose to write documentation for some of the rules for Warhammer 40k 10th edition rules.

## Description

This certificate builds upon previous html and css skills from previous courses. In this I have utilised tables, coding sections and nav-bars to display this information.

The documentation is structured into sections covering different phases of the game, it does not contain all of the rules for the game as this page would be significantly longer:

- **Introduction**: Provides a brief overview of the game and the steps before the first turn.
- **Command Phase**: Explains the actions and abilities available during this phase.
- **Movement Phase**: Describes how units can move on the battlefield.
- **Shooting Phase**: Details the use of ranged weapons and their attributes.
- **Assault Phase**: Covers melee combat and the mechanics of charging into enemy units.

Each section is well-organized with headers and explanatory text, supplemented by tables presenting key information such as unit statistics and weapon attributes.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the documentation.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing the styling for the HTML document.

## Technologies Used
