        <p>First a unit must roll 2D6 dice to see if they can make the charge. If the number rolled is equal to or higher than the distance between the two units, you can charge with your unit.</p>

        <p>You then select which melee weapon you wish to use, roll a number of dice equal to the A(attacks) characteristic of the weapon. You need to roll higher than the Ws of the weapon. Compare the strength of the weapon to the opponents toughness, the enemy model then makes a saving throw, and takes damage equal to the D (damage) of the weapon.</p>
